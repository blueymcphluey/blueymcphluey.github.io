The world is changing and the traditional rules for structuring society don't make sense any more.</div>

		<div class="ptag">Technology that is currently in its relative infancy such as self-driving cars, Amazon Go, farmbot and machine learning algorithms are predicted to put approximately 50% of the workforce out of a job within the next 20 years<a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/new-study-shows-nearly-half-of-us-jobs-at-risk-of-computerisation"><sup>1</sup></a> and while all evidence shows that new "bullshit jobs"<a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/public-service/the-modern-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-20130831-2sy3j.html"><sup>2</sup></a> will be invented to keep everyone busy, the reality is that we don't need everybody working to keep society functioning (and if we did then there wouldn't be more job-seekers than there are jobs<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/only-one-job-advertised-for-every-six-low-skilled-jobseekers-report"><sup>3</sup></a>).

Today that figure in Australia is closer to 1%<a href="https://www.nff.org.au/farm-facts.html"><sup>4</sup></a> (and with fully automated farming technology recently introduced to the market<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNkADHZStDE"><sup>5</sup></a> we could see that figure soon move closer to 0%) which leaves a huge amount of "slack" in the economy.

		<div class="ptag">Comparing a Basic Income to a means tested program that is only targeted towards those in dire poverty gets to the heart of a question around what the role of government should be.

		<div class="ptag">The implication usually behind this line of logic is that if everyone has their basic needs met then it will crash the economy. If true, this is a convincing argument for radially changing the way our economy is structured. Another implication is that if poor people are given more money then they end up having less money. The reasonable thing to do if that were the case would be to abolish Centrelink and the minimum wage in order to help poor people. Even if this line of reasoning was accurate, you could hypothetically counteract the hyperinflation by taxing people and reducing the money supply.</div>

		<div class="ptag">At the end of the day, we have to ask if hyperinflation is a legitemate critique or just a talking point fed to us by people who prefer the status quo.

		<div class="ptag">Not only would it be less bureaucratic and more efficient, but it would also be a powerful symbolic statement that says "everybody deserves to live". In the same way that we say "everybody deserves a basic education" with free public schools, and "everybody deserves access to basic health care" with Medicare. In a modern and civilised society these things should be viewed as rights guaranteed to all and universal programs ensure nobody slips through the cracks.</div>

		<div class="ptag">Means-testing for welfare is a very degrading and dehumanising process that adds additional strain to people who are already struggling. It creates and then stigmatises a class of people who receive targeted welfare, which results in those programs being much easier to cut. When the welfare system is complex and difficult to understand, it becomes harder to mobilise a political defense against those cuts.</div>

		<blockquote>"As soon as you start getting into "Well, these people need the money, and these people don't..." as a criteria for receiving a social benefit, you hit the entirely too familiar merry-go-round of saying that some people are more deserving of 'help' than others. You get to where saying what that upper limit of income and assets ceiling is a mutable, adjustable thing, subject to the whims of politicians"<br> - women4ubi</blockquote>

		<div class="ptag">There will still be jobs. A Basic Income isn't an end to work, it is simply an end to forcing people to work in order to meet their basic needs. Regardless of how people choose to spend their time, we need an affirmative statement that says all people are unconditionally entitled to the resources they need to live.</div>

		<div class="ptag">The idea that people will become destitute and idle when given the option not to work is completely disconnected from any psychological analysis of motivation. For instance, looking at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"><sup>1</sup></a> a Basic Income would cover the two base levels relating to fundamental needs but would still leave many needs to be fulfilled that can't be achieved solely using money.</div>

		<blockquote>"Look at little children who haven't yet started school and therefore haven't yet had their curiosity and playfulness suppressed for the sake of work. Are they lazy? No. They are almost continuously active when not sleeping. They are always getting into things, motivated by curiosity, and in their play they make up stories, build things, create art, and philosophize (yes, philosophize) about the world around them.  There is no reason to think the drives for such activities naturally decline with age.  They decline because our schools, which value work and devalue play, drill them out of people; and then tedious jobs and careers continue to drill them out.  These drives don't decline in hunter-gatherers with age, and they wouldn't decline in us either if it weren't for all the work imposed on us"<br> - Peter Gray</blockquote>

		<div class="ptag">Let's be explicitly clear: a Basic Income shouldn't be used as an excuse to gut the current welfare system and leave people worse off than they are today. Programs such as the NDIS and public education would still play a critical role in a world with a Basic Income. What is likely to happen is that many programs dedicated to serving people in poverty would have far less clients when every citizen is unconditionally receiving a livable wage. A tangled web of means-tested bureaucracy would not need to be cut, it would simply become redundant.</div>

		<div class="ptag">Given that the policy is universal by definition, a Basic Income can't be trialled because every trial will be insufficient. (Much like with vaccines against diseases, a vaccination against poverty would likely show significantly greater results due to "herd immunity"<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated"><sup>1</sup></a>). Given that all trials will be insufficient, you could say that we have had a trial running here in Australia for the past 70 years in the form of an various social security welfare payments that have successfully saved millions from abject poverty. 
		<!-- Unfortunately many others are not saved<a href="https://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/about/homelessness-statistics"><sup>2</sup></a>. -->
		</div>

		<div class="ptag">But Australian welfare is very heavily means tested so a reasonable question to ask is if non-means-tested welfare has been trialled. It has. Many times<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/wiki/index#wiki_that.27s_all_very_well.2C_but_where.27s_the_evidence.3F"><sup>2</sup></a> throughout a variety of different cultures and regularly shows positive results such as increased mental/physical health, decreases in crime, students able to more clearly focus on studies, new parents being able to devote more time to taking care of children.</div>

		<blockquote>"It is weird to me that the abolition of poverty is something that we need to prove would be good. The idea that we need these trials to see if it works is mistaken and a bit of a distraction. Basic income is mostly a matter of taking economic security and freedom seriously.
